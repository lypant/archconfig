T.B.C.

TODO LIST:
- Check if "Sudo" versions of functions are needed now, when all install is done from root account
- Check dwm installation - problems with git email type etc - probably caused by not configured git (probably dotfiles need to be set up earlier)
    - Several possibilities:
        1. Set up root credentials and commit as root
        2. Set up dotfiles for regular user and commit as regular user
        3. Set up local regular user credenrials and commit as regular user
    So far - option 1. taken
