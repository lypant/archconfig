T.B.C.

TODO LIST:
- Check dwm installation - problems with git email type etc - probably caused by not configured git (probably dotfiles need to be set up earlier)
    - Several possibilities:
        1. Set up root credentials and commit as root
        2. Set up dotfiles for regular user and commit as regular user
        3. Set up local regular user credenrials and commit as regular user
    So far - option 1. taken
- When finished with executeCommand etc - ensure each function returns value and check it. In case of failure, break installation for easier problem finding
- When copying log file after install - not complete log file is being copied, since after copy operation few logs are added. Think about better solution.
- Determine and use consistent policy with executeCommand calls. Probably all commands should be surrounded with single quotation marks, e.g. '<command>'
