Redirect output of scripts to log files to be able to see what went wrong in case of a failure

Add sudoers in a safe way

Split configuration, download and install scripts so that download and installation can be separated easily and performed in steps?

Parametrization:

!!! Check - does usage of settings variables require inclusion of settings file or they are passed down the loaded scripts?

get.sh
Repository/branch as an optional parameter
Secondary: Destination dir as a parameter

install.sh
Settings file - provide full path.

settings.conf
Repository should match that one from get.sh
