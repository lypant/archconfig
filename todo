After installing base system /mnt/archconfig gets deleted.
It is necessary to clone the repo again.
Although - different set of scripts will be necessary.
This allows for creating different branches for different stages.
But maybe it is overkill and it is better to have everything in one place.


!!! Maybe clone to other location - e.g. /var/archconfig ???
Probably this would not be overwritten during pacstrapping


!!! Don't forget to remove archconfig from first location when installation is done
Or think where it could be installed to keep it there even when installation is complete

!!! Use script parameter to pass host and user names

!!! Use tee to produce logs when running config scripts !!!

Split customisation into different layers - e.g. programs, eye candy etc.
